                            Bailey Minzenberger is a Chicago based musician. They were moved by musical expression since a young age; first beginning with the drums, with a heavy focus on pop-punk and alternative rock. Minzenberger began playing guitar at the age of 12, mostly playing covers for enjoyment. They picked up the piano around the same age after being intensely moved by Chopin’s “Nocturne in C# Minor”. Throughout high school, Minzenberger played in multiple bands, beginning with a funk group on drums. Following this, they played in a prog-rock band on guitar, and finally a funk-pop group on bass.

                            <br> Minzenberger did not begin singing or writing their own music until the summer of 2017, and released their debut EP, Queen Anne’s Lace, soon afterwards. The EP was recorded by Minzenberger in their bedroom and was written as a gift for a loved one. They continued to write music for personal enjoyment, and finally began recording their first album, Dramamine, during the winter of 2018. Minzenberger composed and played all of the instruments on the record. Recorded at “Wolf’s Den Records,” Dramamine provides an intimate representation of Minzenberger as a musician and as a person. Through emotionally vulnerable lyrics and their love for sonic texture, Dramamine is a culmination of Minzenberger’s musical and personal history.
